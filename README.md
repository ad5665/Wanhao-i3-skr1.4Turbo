# Wanhao-i3-skr1.4Turbo
Wanhao i3 V2.1 conversion to SKR 1.4 turbo


Big thanks to simcole for his configuration:

Note
I haven't removed the sensor pins on the TMC2209 
To do this, comment out //E0_DIAG_PIN and //E1_DIAG_PIN in .\Marlin\src\pins\lpc1768\pins_BTT_SKR_V1.4.h file


TODO
Update to Marlin 2.0.6
